"""Export the dashboard payload: docs/data/restaurants.json.

Usage: python src/export_site_data.py [--check] [--quiet] [--allow-shrink]
  --check  build and validate the payload, print the report, write nothing
  --quiet  suppress the per-section summary
  --allow-shrink  write even when the roster lost more than a fifth of its rows

ToS (nyctourism.com: personal/noncommercial, no republication). This exporter
emits DERIVED/FACTUAL fields only. It must never write `menus.raw_text`, a
`menu_items` listing, or anything else that reproduces a menu. Menus are LINKED
via the official S3 PDF url. The only menu-derived text allowed out is a short
`menu_item_tags` snippet, re-centred on the matched keyword and capped by
SNIPPET_PAD below, deduplicated so overlapping snippets can't be reassembled
into a contiguous passage. assert_tos_clean() enforces this at the end.

Precedence rule for every field: the restaurant's own printed materials
(config/verified_values.json) beat the listing API. price_sweep is heuristic
triage and may NEVER populate a "verified" field.

# across every rated restaurant here, m = how many reviews it takes before we
# mostly believe the restaurant's own average.

# percentile is 188 reviews, so most restaurants stay essentially themselves
# (Manhatta 4.7 -> 4.69), while the 27 restaurants under 100 reviews get pulled
# meaningfully toward the middle (Maison Madison 4.9 -> 4.53). Larger values
# over-correct -- at m=400 Le B.'s 3.4 from 227 reviews is dragged to 4.10,
