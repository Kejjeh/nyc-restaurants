"""Build the canonical VENUE roster: every NYC restaurant with award recognition.

Usage: python src/build_venues.py [--quiet]

The site used to be a Restaurant Week tool, so its universe was "the 636
restaurants in this season's listing" and an award was a badge one of them
might carry. That had the relationship backwards. An award is the durable
fact -- Michelin, the Beard Foundation and the Times keep recognising the same
restaurants for decades -- while Restaurant Week participation is a marketing
decision one restaurant makes in one summer.

So: VENUES is the roster. `rw_slug` is a nullable column on it. Being in
Restaurant Week is now a property a venue may or may not have, alongside
holding a star or being closed.

Inputs
  data/processed/restaurant_week.sqlite   (restaurants: this season's listing)
  data/raw/recognition/*.json             (the award lists, unfiltered)
  config/awards.json                      (sources, honor points, weights)

Outputs (same DB)
  venues        one row per real restaurant, RW or not, open or not
  venue_awards  one row per award record, attached to a venue

  data/processed/venue_merge_review.json  every merge this refused to make

MERGING IS THE WHOLE PROBLEM. Michelin and the Times give addresses; the Beard
Foundation gives none at all, for 1,363 records spanning 35 years. The rules
below are deliberately conservative in different ways per source, and anything
they will not decide is written to the review file rather than guessed. The
cost of a wrong merge is two restaurants silently becoming one row; the cost of
a missed merge is one restaurant appearing twice. Both are bad. Only the first
is invisible, so that is the one the thresholds are set against.

    build_venues rebuilds the roster from scratch every run, so without this a

    restaurants is absent from the next listing it is re-created from its award
    records under a different slug, and the weekly report reads that as a
    departure and an arrival rather than as the same restaurant.

    The ledger is the memory that makes a slug an identity: once a restaurant
    has one it keeps it, whichever source happens to seed it next season.

    Reuse is not on name alone. Two different restaurants share a name often
    enough (and the roster already carries "-2" slugs for them) that handing

    and after issue #2 its paid Places lookup with it. An entry is eligible only

        saint ambroeus                   / sant ambroeus     ratio 0.963

    The pair that must NOT merge scores HIGHER than the pair that must. Ratio
    is measuring the wrong thing: what separates them is not how much of the

    of the other or a word chosen to contrast with it.

    So: exactly one token may differ on each side, and those two tokens must
    look like one word written twice -- similar, and starting with the same
    letter. "boon"/"boons" and "momfuku"/"momofuku" pass; "east"/"west" fails

        mam / mamo            Mắm on the Lower East Side, Mamo in SoHo
        sevilla / semilla     Sevilla in the West Village, Semilla in Williamsburg

    What they have in common is that the differing token is the ENTIRE name.
    There is no second word left to agree, so the similarity is the whole of
    the evidence and one letter decides a merge. The pairs that are genuinely
    one restaurant always keep something: "ambroeus", "verde", "ssam bar",
    "uncle". So a spelling variant must also share at least one other token --
