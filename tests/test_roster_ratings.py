"""The roster's Rating sort had nothing to sort on.

`venues.rating` was NULL for all 1,414 rows, so weightedRating() returned null
for every venue, the "Google rating — weighted" sort silently fell through to
prestige for every pair, and the star line on the row never rendered once.

The ratings were not missing. 629 of the 636 Restaurant Week participants have
a Google record in data/raw/google/, published on the dashboard next door and
committed to this repo. resolve_venues.unresolved() skips those rows on purpose
-- they arrive from the listing with coordinates and never needed a lookup --
and a rating is not a coordinate. Nothing errored; a control was simply inert.

The second half is the shrinkage constant. docs/venues.js recomputed the
weighted score itself with `PRIOR = 300` while every payload in the project
uses 150, under a comment saying it gave ratings "the same treatment" the
dashboard does. On this data that reorders 452 of the 629 rated rows.
